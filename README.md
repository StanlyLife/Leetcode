### Why do you use Leetcode?
My personal opninion is that most web developers doesnt require the best DSA (data structures & algorithms) skills
compared to other fields such as data scientists and IOT developers.
However I personally find these problems to be both challenging and fun which are my main reasons for creating this repository.
### Disclaimer

- The goal is to create the optimal solution in regards of runtime, not clean code.
